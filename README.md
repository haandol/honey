# Honey

A neat [Slack](slack.com) bot for Pythonistas

## Dependencies

Python 3.5.3+ (for `async/await`)

[redis](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py), [slackclient](https://github.com/slackhq/python-slackclient).

```bash
$pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

If you are using Python 2.x use [0.0.3](https://github.com/haandol/honey/tree/0.0.3)

Like Django, you can config your bot by editing `settings.py`

set `SLACK_TOKEN` variable in settings.py.
if `REDIS_URL` is not setted, all Redis relevant features, like redis_brain, will be disabled.

### Congiure your bot

1. install dependencies
2. Add your bot for your slack account at [Custom Integration Page](https://my.slack.com/services/new/bot)
3. Copy API Token to clipboard.
4. Open `settings.py`
5. Set `SLACK_TOKEN`. You can set `REDIS_URL` if it's available.
6. Run `$python robot.py`. Python 3.5.3+ is required.
7. Invite your bot to the channel `/invite @YOUR_BOT_NAME`

> üëπ 2nd step is important because RTM is working only with legacy bot.

### Play with it on the Slack

Type command with Command Prefix (default is `!` ) on the channel where the bot is on.

Honey is going to respond to your command kindly.

```
YOU: !help

Honey: Hello world!!
```

## Apps

We call each function that you plugged-in to the Honey, the app.

Built-in and example apps are in the `apps` directory.

### App and Command

Below is basic form of app. notice that the function has prefix, `async`.
This just says `Hello world!!` to the channel when user typed the command, `!hi`.

```python
from .decorators import on_command

@on_command(['hi', 'hello', 'ÌïòÏù¥', '„Öé„Öá'])
async def hello_world(robot, channel, user, tokens):
    '''
        Simple app just says `Hello word!!`

        @params {object} robot - Honey bot instance
        @params {str} channel - channel name where invoked this app
        @params {str} user - user id who invoked this app
        @params {list} tokens - user input tokens
        @returns {str, str} - channel name, message
    '''
    return channel, 'Hello world!!'
```

And Honey supports multiple commands for each function.

The above app can be invoked the command with Command Prefix (default is `!`) on the channel.
It would be `!hello`, `!hi`, `!ÌïòÏù¥` or `!„Öé„Öá`


### Tokenizer

Honey automatically split your message into tokens by whitespaces.

Let's assume that you typed `!memo remember this` with blow app.

```python
@on_command(['memo'])
async def remember(robot, channel, user, tokens):
    assert 2 == len(tokens)
    assert 'remember' == tokens[0]
    assert 'this' == tokens[1]
    return channel, tokens[1]
```

You may want tokens containing whitespaces.
In that case, wrap your token with double quote(") like

```bash
!memo remember "kill -9 $(ps aux | grep gunicorn | grep -v 'grep' | awk '{print $2 }')"
```

### Redis Brain

Honey supports semi-permanent storage using Redis as well as Hubot.

The full usage code is on `apps/redis_brain`. If you want to use the feature, just add `redis_brain` to `APPS` variable at your `settings.py`

Let's assume that you typed `!memo whats this` in your channel with below app.

after that, whenever you type `!memo whats` Honey will says `this` to the channel.

if you forgot what you memoized, just type `!memo`. Honey let you know what she memoized before.

### Register your app

1. Add your app and put it into `apps` folder
2. open `settings.py` and add your app name(like `hello_world`) to `APPS`
3. restart your bot
